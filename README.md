# Airbnb Mini Project


## Overview
This project explores Airbnb listing data through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The goal is to analyze pricing trends by bedroom count, geographic location, and time, providing a clear view of how various factors influence Airbnb pricing.

The dashboard showcases:
- Average price per bedroom
- Listing distribution by bedroom count
- Price comparisons by zipcode (map + bar chart)
- Revenue trends over time

## Dataset
The original dataset is from Kaggle: [Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset] (www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset)

## How to Open
1. Download the `.twbx` file.
2. Use Tableau Desktop to open the `.twbx` file 

Everything needed to view and interact with the dashboards is included in the packaged workbook (`.twbx`).

## Key Insights
- **Bedroom Pricing:** Average price rises significantly with the number of bedrooms. Single-bedroom listings dominate the dataset, but larger properties (5–6 bedrooms) command much higher prices.  
- **Listing Distribution:** Most listings are concentrated in the 1–2 bedroom range, suggesting Airbnb demand favors smaller units.  
- **Zipcode Variation:** Prices vary substantially by zipcode. Some zipcodes consistently command higher average prices, highlighting the importance of location.  
- **Revenue Over Time:** Revenue shows steady growth throughout the year, with seasonal fluctuations that may correspond to travel demand cycles.  


## Findings & Business Insights  
- **For Hosts:** Smaller properties (1–2 bedrooms) are the most common, meaning competition is highest there. Larger listings, while fewer in number, earn significantly more per night.  
- **For Guests:** Location greatly affects price. Guests can find better deals in zipcodes with lower average prices, especially if proximity to high-demand areas isn’t a priority.  
- **For Policy Makers:** Concentration of high-priced listings in certain neighborhoods could impact local housing markets, making these areas candidates for closer regulatory review.
